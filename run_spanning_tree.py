# Spanning Tree project for GA Tech OMS-CS CS 6250 Computer Networks
#
# Usage:
# Generically, it is run as follows:
#     python run_spanning_tree.py <topology_file> <log_file>
# For instance, to run jellyfish_topo.py and log to jellyfish.log that we created, use the following:
#     python run_spanning_tree.py jellyfish_topo jellyfish.log
# Note how the topology file doesn't have the .py extension.
#
# Students should not modify this file.
