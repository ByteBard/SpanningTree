    This class defines a Switch that can can send and receive spanning tree
    messages to converge on a final, loop-free forwarding topology. This class
    is a child class of the StpSwitch class. To remain within the spirit of
    the project, the only inherited members functions a student is permitted
    to use are:

    switchID: int
        the ID number of this switch object)
    links: list
        the list of switch IDs connected to this switch object)
    send_message(Message msg)
        Sends a Message object to another switch)

    Student code MUST use the send_message function to implement the algorithm.
    A non-distributed algorithm will not receive credit.

    Student code should NOT access the following members, otherwise they may violate
    the spirit of the project:

    topolink: Topology
        a parameter passed to initialization function
    topology: Topology
        a link to the greater topology structure used for message passing
